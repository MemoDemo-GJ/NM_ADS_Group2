# Future Sales Prediction

## Abstract:

Future sales prediction entails the sophisticated utilization of advanced analytical methodologies, notably regression analysis and machine learning paradigms, to prognosticate prospective sales trends predicated on antecedent historical data. It encompasses the discerning extraction of intricate patterns, correlations, and discernments immanent within the dataset to formulate judicious estimations concerning the quantum and typology of products or services that an enterprise is poised to transact in the ensuing temporal domain. This proactive modus operandi confers upon organizations the capacity to finesse inventory dynamics, meticulously calibrate resource allocation, and refine overall operational efficacy, thereby cultivating a discernible competitive advantage within the intricate tapestry of the commercial milieu.

In the dynamic landscape of modern business, the ability to anticipate and adapt to future sales trends is paramount for sustained success. This project explores the application of regression analysis and machine learning techniques to predict future sales. By leveraging historical sales data and relevant features, our objective is to develop a robust predictive model that provides actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Problem Statement:

The problem is to develop a predictive model that uses historical sales data to forecast future sales for a retail company. The objective is to create a tool that enables the company to optimize inventory management and make informed business decisions based on data-driven sales predictions. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## Design Thinking:

Regression is an important machine learning model for these kinds of problems. Predicting sales of a company needs time series data of that company and based on that data, the model can predict the future sales of that company or product. So, in this research project, we will analyze the time series sales data of a company and will predict the sales of the company for the coming quarter and for a specific product. For this kind of project of sales predict, we will apply linear regression and logistic regression and evaluate the result based on the training, testing, and validation set of the data.

## Methodology:

In this project, linear regression and logistic regression models will be trained and tested for our dataset. For this, we will download the sample dataset from the given link in the dataset section. The raw data is then undergoing for feature selection and feature extraction. After that, we will apply machine learning regression models such as Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost Regressor, LightGBM, Ensemble Model, etc., for the training dataset to train the model. These trained models will be then tested on the test dataset and validation dataset for checking the accuracy of the models and compared to each other for performance and accuracy measurements.

## Conclusion:

In the culmination of our Future Sales Prediction project, we've transformed data into strategic foresight. Our meticulously crafted model, born from comprehensive data preprocessing and thoughtful feature engineering, now stands as a reliable compass for inventory optimization. With a chosen model fine-tuned through training and evaluation, we've bridged the gap between abstract algorithms and actionable insights. The interpretability woven into our predictions ensures a clear narrative for stakeholders, empowering them to make informed decisions. As we deploy this tool into our business landscape, it's not just a conclusion but the dawn of a data-driven era, where our predictive model becomes a guiding force for agile and informed decision-making in the dynamic retail arena.
